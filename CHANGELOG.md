## [Preview Release 2.0.0-preview4.20142.4] - 2020-05-21

### Added
- Microsoft.Data.SqlClient (.NET Core and .NET Standard) on Windows is now dependent on **Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.SNI.runtime**, replacing the previous dependency on **runtime.native.System.Data.SqlClient.SNI** [#570](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/pull/570)
- The new **Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.SNI.runtime** dependency adds support for the *ARM* platform along with the already supported platforms *ARM64*, *x64* and *x86* on Windows [#570](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/pull/570)
- Improved driver performance by introducing managed packet recycling [#389](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/pull/389)

### Breaking Changes
- For .NET Framework applications consuming **Microsoft.Data.SqlClient**, the `SNI.dll` files previously downloaded to the `bin\x64` and `bin\x86` folders are now named `Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.SNI.x64.dll` and `Microsoft.Data.SqlClient.SNI.x86.dll` and will be downloaded to the `bin` directory, to support auto-loading in the application process [#570](https://github.com/dotnet/SqlClient/pull/570). This change is not going to impact client applications unless a direct reference has been made to `SNI.dll` or the x86 and x64 folders.
